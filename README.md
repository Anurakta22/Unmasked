We are thrilled to present our modern deepfake detection net app ‘Unmasked’, an unparalleled solution to the ever-increasing dangers of faux digital. inside the age of growing misinformation and disinformation, our app emerges as a harbinger of desire – hope for the recuperation of believe and authentication within the digital environment. Our website is built upon the cutting-edge synthetic intelligence and deep learning technology tightly packed to scrutinize multimedia documents down to the tiniest element and tell the distinction more as it should be. the use of superior statistical models like CNN model using ResNet 50 and VGG16, and deep learning algorithms like Kera's and Tensorflow, our app scans your report frame by-frame, analyzing facial morphology and surroundings cues to discover deep fakes. Our app has been designed based on person-focused layout which could be very user-pleasant. every person can use it from the journalist who offers extra credibility and precedence to journalism to the normal social media consumer surrounded by way of a digital maze, and to the commercial enterprise suffering to control their popularity. It additionally has a sport where players must discover faux photographs from a blend of real and fake ones. gamers interact with the sport via choosing if each picture proven is real or faux. the sport gives feedback on the accuracy of the participant's preference and data their score as they improve in the game. players can hone their abilities in distinguishing between real and faux photos in a amusing and interactive way. Universal, our photo detection system gives a strong and adaptable solution for addressing image analysis challenges in different regions. via incorporating era and techniques, our gadget enables customers to derive significant findings from visual statistics, fueling improvements and development inside the realm of photo detection. Unmasked uses advanced deep learning technology, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN) like VGG16 and ResNet50, to classify images. 
Overall Description :The process of system analysis and design is essential for developing software systems. It includes identifying and analyzing system needs to meet user needs. It also involves designing system layout, components, and interfaces for optimal performance. 
Functional Requirements:  
Deepfake Detection: Allow users to upload images with human faces to determine if they are real or fake. The system will use a deep learning model to procedure the images and confirm their authenticity.  
Spot the Fake! Put users in a game where they must do difference between real and fake images. The system will display images for users to guess whether they are real or AI-or fake generated.  
About Us: Provide users with information about the project team and its goals. Users can learn about team members, their roles and the project's objectives.  
Non-functional Requirements: 
Performance: The app should provide pace and accurate deepfake detection and image-guessing game functionalities. Response times should be least, and the system should be able to handle multiple user interactions together without any significant delays. 
User Interface: The user interface should be intuitive, eye catching, and easy to navigate. It should provide clear instructions for users to upload images, play the game, and give information about the team. 
Scalability: The app should handle many users and image uploads together. It should scale seamlessly to accommodate increasing user traffic without affecting performance. 
The technology stack includes Stream lit for the front end, which allows us to create a user-friendly web interface with visualizations. On the backend, we use TensorFlow for deep learning-based image processing, which helps us accurately analyze images. For data visualization, we used Matplotlib and Plotly express to present information appealingly. Additionally, we use PIL for image processing to resize and manipulate images efficiently, and Requests for making HTTP requests to facilitate communication between system components.
